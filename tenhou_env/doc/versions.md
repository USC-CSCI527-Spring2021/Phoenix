It can reach a tempai and call a riichi. It doesn't know about dora, yaku, defence and etc. 
Only about tempai and riichi so far.

This version had played 335 games (hanchans) and achieved only first dan (初段) on the tenhou.net so far
(and lost it later, and achieved it again...).

Rate was somewhere around R1350.
